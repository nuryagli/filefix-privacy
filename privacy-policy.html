        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last updated: December 1, 2025</p>

        <p>
            FileFix ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our mobile application FileFix (the "App").
        </p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
            FileFix is designed with privacy in mind. We collect minimal information:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No Personal Data:</strong> We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information such as your name, email address, phone number, or location.</li>
            <li><strong>No File Data:</strong> All file processing (PDFs, images) happens entirely on your device. Your files never leave your phone and are never uploaded to our servers or any third-party servers.</li>
            <li><strong>App Usage Data:</strong> We may collect anonymous usage statistics (such as which features are used most) to improve the app, but this data cannot identify you personally.</li>
            <li><strong>Subscription Information:</strong> If you purchase a premium subscription, payment processing is handled by Google Play Store or Apple App Store. We only receive confirmation of your subscription status, not your payment details.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
        <p>
            The minimal information we collect is used solely to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide and improve the App's functionality</li>
            <li>Process subscription transactions through app stores</li>
            <li>Understand app usage patterns to enhance user experience</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Data Processing</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>All file processing happens on your device.</strong> When you merge PDFs, compress images, or perform any other operations, these actions are completed entirely on your mobile device. No files are uploaded to our servers or any cloud service.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>
            We do not share, sell, or rent your information to third parties. The only exceptions are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>App Stores:</strong> Subscription payments are processed by Google Play Store or Apple App Store, which have their own privacy policies.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose information if required by law or to protect our rights.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            FileFix uses the following third-party services:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google Play Billing / Apple App Store:</strong> For processing in-app purchases and subscriptions. Their privacy policies apply to payment transactions.</li>
            <li><strong>No Analytics Services:</strong> We do not use Google Analytics, Firebase Analytics, or similar tracking services.</li>
            <li><strong>No Advertising:</strong> FileFix does not contain advertisements, so no ad networks collect your data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
        <p>
            Since all file processing happens on your device, your files are secure. We do not have access to your files, so there is no risk of data breaches on our servers. However, you are responsible for:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Keeping your device secure</li>
            <li>Not sharing your device with unauthorized users</li>
            <li>Using device-level security features (passcodes, biometrics)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            FileFix is not intended for children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>
            Since we collect minimal information, you have the right to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use the App without providing any personal information</li>
            <li>Cancel your subscription at any time through your app store settings</li>
            <li>Delete the App, which removes all local data from your device</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
